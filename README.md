Energy Consumption Prediction using ML

Description: Predict energy consumption based on features like temperature, time of day, etc.

Dataset: Use the Energy Consumption Dataset (available on Kaggle).

Steps:

> Load and preprocess the dataset.
> Split the data into training and testing sets.
> Train a linear regression model.
> Predict energy consumption for new data points.
> Evaluate the model using metrics like MSE or R-squared.
> Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib.
